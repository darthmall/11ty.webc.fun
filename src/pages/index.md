This website is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) and [WebC](https://github.com/11ty/webc) to elucidate techniques for using them together.

You should not consider the techniques illustrated as recommendations — or “best practices”, as they say.
This website is as much a testbed for WebC as it is a showcase.
It is an experiment intended to explore what can be done with WebC and Eleventy.
