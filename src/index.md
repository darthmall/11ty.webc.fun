> The proof of the pudding is in the eating.

Here is a website built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) and [WebC](https://github.com/11ty/webc) that is about how you can build websites with Eleventy and WebC.
It is a test bed.
The recipes youâ€™ll find here were used to develop this very site.
Exciting, I know.
